                  Growing up, the highlight of my school holidays was staying with my cousin Ray. Sometimes she'd stay 
                  at our home. Other times, I'd stay in her home.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I remember those holidays in Siglap. Her dad, Dr Peter Wee HL was passionate about eschatology. He, 
                  my dad and all their brothers were huge comic book fans. My uncle has a library with decades worth of 
                  carefully preserved comic books. One of my favourite things then was to raid his collection. We'd get 
                  stacks of comics and spend the afternoons in the fantasy world of DC comics.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Meals were memorable with lively discourse on eschatology and comic book storylines. The book of 
                  Revelation was often a dinner topic which brought endless fascination although at that tender age, 
                  I struggled to follow their discussions.

                  That was decades ago.

                <p>
                  Now, I feel a strong calling to write this epic. It's too difficult a project for me to do alone. My 
                  uncle, Dr Peter Wee has been amazing in guiding me through the difficult bits of Revelation and 
                  Eschatology so that I could write the novel,{' '}
