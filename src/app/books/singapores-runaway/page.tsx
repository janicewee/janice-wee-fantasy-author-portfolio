                My daddy told me that when my grandpa was young, his mom died and his dad remarried. Grandpa was so upset when great grandpa brought home his new step mom that he ran away and joined a ship's crew, sailing away from Singapore. His new stepmom was a good woman and got her brothers to use their family's ships to scour the seas around Singapore, from Malaysia, Indonesia and possibly further in search of Grandfather. They had their own business and ships to bring in the goods and used these resources to look for Grandpa. One of his step mom's brothers found him on an island in Indonesia and convinced him to return to Singapore. That was the inspiration of this story. Dad told me of grandpa's heroism - how he swam out to sea to rescue a drowning woman. These two stories inspired my tale. The rest of the book is pure fiction.

                "As a Singaporean now living in Canada, this book brought back so many memories of my Singaporean people and history that are absolutely still a vital part of me! I was thrown into the sounds of water, the mix of our unique languages, the racial dynamics, plus some mystical and historical folklore! Fun, easy to read, engaging. Plus this being written by my own family member, taking our family history into a new interpretation, is completely thrilling! Well Done!"
