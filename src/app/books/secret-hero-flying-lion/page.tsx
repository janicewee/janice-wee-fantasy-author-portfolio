                  Billy Lionheart received super strength in his previous adventure, but now it's becoming 
                  a problem. As he and Bluma return to St Lydia's Academy for a new school term, Billy's

                  Meanwhile, Leonard Lion receives a technology upgrade from Immortal King Jayden: flying 
                  gloves that should allow him to soar through the skies. There's just one problemâ€”Leonard 
                  can't figure out how to use them! His attempts at flight result in comedic crashes and 
                  near-disasters that leave everyone on edge.

                  succeed.
