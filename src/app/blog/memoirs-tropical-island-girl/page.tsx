            <p>
              When I first wrote <Link href="/books/little-nonyas-escapades" className="text-primary hover:underline">Little Nonya Escapades</Link>, I intended to write a fictional story, using my own childhood memories as an initial draft.
            </p>

            <p>
              I had an amazing childhood. Dad and Mum were both schoolteachers who spent a lot of quality time with me. When my parents were working, grandpa doted on me.
            </p>

            <p>
              When it was time to go to primary school, they enrolled me in Daddy's school. Every day for those 6 years, when I was in the car with Daddy, he was Daddy. When I got out of the car and was in school grounds, he was Mr Wee. I was proud of my "professionalism" back then. I never knew until decades later, after he had passed on, that it hurt him. The other teachers' kids called their parents "Daddy" or "Mummy" if they happened to meet. I was the only one who greeted my dad like any student would greet a teacher, with that respectful nod and impersonal greeting.
            </p>

            <p>
              As I wrote, I poured my memories of those six years into my manuscript. I could remember every detail as clearly as if it had happened yesterday. I shared the first draft, my raw memories with my sister, for feedback. I had changed all the names except Daddy's and Teacher Elizabeth. That was my first step in "fictionalising" my story.
            </p>

            <p>
              She advised me to keep it as is. Let it be my autobiography.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm fifty-six now. All this happened almost fifty years ago. Some of these events were so outlandish, readers would assume these to be figments of my imagination, so I didn't bother to turn any of it into fiction. No one would know the difference anyway.... Unless they happened to be there all those decades ago. I changed the names of everyone in the story to protect all identities.
            </p>

            <p>
              I don't think that really worked. Mum read it and in spite of the name changes, she knew every character. She even pointed out that I had forgotten to include Uncle Lye Hoe in one of the scenes. Oops.
            </p>

            <p>
              I didn't change Teacher Elizabeth's name because for so many decades, I wondered what happened to her. After that scene I described in my book, she disappeared. I never saw her again. I hoped that somehow somewhere, she might pick up my book and read it, and know what I never had a chance to tell her.
            </p>

            <p>
              After I published <Link href="/books/little-nonyas-escapades" className="text-primary hover:underline"><strong>Little Nonya Escapades</strong></Link>, I asked my mother about her. Teacher Elizabeth disappeared because she had joined OMF and had become a missionary in India. She had just retired and was finally back in Singapore after all these decades. I got her number from my mother.
            </p>

            <p>
              Teacher Elizabeth never answers calls from numbers she did not recognise, but when I called her, for some unknown reason, she answered my call. We met for lunch with my mum, and have been meeting up every once in a while. The best news?
            </p>

            <p>
              She's my Godma now. üòç

              Ask my mom.<br />
              If her blood pressure shoots up, yeah, that story actually happened.
